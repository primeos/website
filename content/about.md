Hello, World! I'm Michael Weiss, aka primeos, a computer science student and
NixOS developer from Germany. I love FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software)
and I'm mainly interested in GNU/Linux (from a sysadmin's perspective) as well
as computer networks. For fun, I really like, amongst other things, watching
movies and TV shows (probably also because I'm interested in computer graphics
and of course fascinated by its magic :D).
