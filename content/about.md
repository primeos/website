Hello, World! I'm Michael Weiss, aka primeos, a software engineer and
NixOS developer from Germany. I love FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software)
and I'm mainly interested in GNU/Linux (from a sysadmin's perspective) as well
as computer networks.
I like hiking, cycling, technology / modern infrastructure, cars (both driving
and from a technological perspective), and watching movies and TV shows
(probably also because I'm interested in computer graphics and of course
fascinated by its magic :D - my favorite genres are probably Sci-Fi (especially
Cyberpunk) and Animation).
